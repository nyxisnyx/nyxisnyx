- 👋 Hi, I’m @nyxisnyx, a Belgian Web Developer and writer. 
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end technologies as well as web-oriented solutions to develop and play games.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many techs and languages, as I'm enroled in a renowned learning program here in Belgium (see BeCode.org).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on choose your own adventure games, and I'm available to translate most things from English to French for a fee (email me for my rates!)
- 📫 How to reach me: coming soon
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: Ever since I learned to crochet, I've taken to doing it while I walk to and from work. I love keeping my hands busy.
